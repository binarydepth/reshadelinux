## Understand credit and scope

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ReShade itself is created and maintained by [crosire](https://reshade.me/) and the wider ReShade contributor community. This repository does not replace ReShade. It automates downloading the official ReShade release, selecting shader packs, and wiring everything into Wine or Proton game installs on Linux.
> [!NOTE]
> This project continues the work started in [kevinlekiller/reshade-steam-proton](https://github.com/kevinlekiller/reshade-steam-proton). Credit for the original Linux installer flow belongs to [kevinlekiller](https://github.com/kevinlekiller). Credit for ReShade itself belongs to [crosire](https://github.com/crosire) and ReShade contributors.

## Start with the AppImage

Download the latest AppImage from the [Releases](https://github.com/asafelobotomy/reshadelinux/releases) page.

```bash
chmod +x reshadelinux-*-x86_64.AppImage
./reshadelinux-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

The AppImage bundles the launcher and project scripts. It does **not** bundle the tools they call, so install `7z` (`p7zip-full` on Debian and Ubuntu, `7zip` on Arch), `git`, `curl`, `file` and `python3` first, plus `yad` for the graphical interface. If one is missing the app shows an error dialog naming it and the package to install. The first run downloads the official ReShade payload from [reshade.me](https://reshade.me/).

## Run from source

Install `grep`, `7z`, `curl`, `git`, `file`, `python3`, `sed`, and `sha256sum`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asafelobotomy/reshadelinux.git
cd reshadelinux
./reshadelinux.sh
```

Install `yad` when you want the graphical flow. If `yad` is unavailable, the script falls back to `whiptail`, then `dialog`, then plain CLI prompts. When it is started from the application menu (no terminal) without `yad`, `reshadelinux-gui.sh` opens a terminal emulator for the text interface instead of doing nothing.

## See what the installer handles

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Game detection | Scans every Steam library and Heroic's installed Epic/GOG metadata to find Windows game executables. |
| DLL selection | Uses PE import analysis to choose the most likely ReShade hook such as `dxgi`, `d3d9`, `opengl32`, `ddraw`, or `dinput8`. |
| Per-game state | Saves DLL, architecture, path, App ID, and selected shader repos per game in `~/.local/share/reshade/game-state/`. |
| Shader curation | Lets each game keep its own selected shader packs while still linking shared `.fxh` headers needed for compile-time includes. |
| Prefix support | Detects Steam Proton and Heroic-configured Wine prefixes, then installs `d3dcompiler_47.dll` where ReShade 6.5+ expects it. |
| Repeat updates | Reuses tracked state for reinstall runs and supports `--update-all` for every known game. |
| Multiple interfaces | Supports `yad`, `whiptail`, `dialog`, and direct CLI execution over the same install flow. |

## Heroic Games Launcher support

When Heroic is installed, its installed Windows games from Epic and GOG, plus Windows games added through Heroic's sideload feature, are included in the same picker as Steam games. The installer reads Heroic's game metadata and the selected game's configured Wine prefix, so the game files and `d3dcompiler_47.dll` are linked into the appropriate locations.

Both native Heroic configuration (`~/.config/heroic`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/heroic`) and Heroic Flatpak configuration (`~/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/config/heroic`) are searched. Sideloaded entries must be marked installed in Heroic and point to an existing Windows executable.

When both **Native** and **Flatpak** installations are detected, the startup prompt asks where ReShadeLinux should store its runtime, shaders, and state. Choose **Manual** to select another data directory. If the chosen directory does not exist, the installer offers to create it. If creation is declined, it asks for an existing game directory containing the `.EXE` and stores ReShade data there instead.

## Choose how first-run installs behave

Brand-new installs do not preselect the entire shader catalog anymore. The first shader checklist now starts with a curated starter set:

- `reshade-shaders`
- `sweetfx-shaders`
- `quintfx`
- `prod80-shaders`
- `astrayfx-shaders`

Legacy installs still keep backward-compatible behavior. If an older state file has no `selected_repos` entry, the script falls back to all configured repos.

## Drive installs from the CLI

Use the CLI path when you want deterministic automation or test coverage.

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --cli --app-id=255710 --dll-override=dxgi --shader-repos=all
./reshadelinux.sh --cli --game-path="$HOME/Games/MyGame" --dll-override=d3d9 --shader-repos=none
./reshadelinux.sh --list-shader-repos
./reshadelinux.sh --list-shader-repos --json
./reshadelinux.sh --generate-vkbasalt-config="$HOME/Games/MyGame"
./reshadelinux.sh --inspect-reshade-parameters="$HOME/Games/MyGame"
# Or pass the game's ReShade.ini directly:
./reshadelinux.sh --inspect-reshade-parameters="$HOME/Games/MyGame/ReShade.ini"
./reshadelinux.sh --version
```

The graphical and terminal UIs are wrappers over the same install logic. The CLI path is the canonical scripted interface.

## Export active effects for vkBasalt

vkBasalt can load many ReShade `.fx` effects directly. For a game already set up with ReShadeLinux, generate a per-game `vkBasalt.conf` from the enabled effect files in its active ReShade preset:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --generate-vkbasalt-config="$HOME/Games/MyGame"
```

The command reads `PresetPath` from the game's `ReShade.ini` (or uses `ReShadePreset.ini`) and resolves enabled techniques against the game's shader paths. If there is no preset, it presents the `.fx` files found through `EffectSearchPaths` in a checklist (or a CLI prompt) so you can choose effects. The selection creates `vkBasalt.conf`; later runs update a config generated by ReShadeLinux but leave an unrelated existing config untouched. The generated file uses the merged texture path and selected effects' common include directory, so keep the ReShadeLinux shader directory in place.

The parameter-inspection command has the same no-preset selection fallback:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --inspect-reshade-parameters="$HOME/Games/MyGame"
```

If no preset is found, this command generates or updates `vkBasalt.conf` from the selected effects rather than reporting preset values.

This exports the distinct `.fx` files referenced by enabled techniques, not ReShade parameter values, per-technique toggles within a shared file, or shader-source transformations. vkBasalt and ReShade do not support identical shader features, so some effects may need manual adjustment or may not load. Install vkBasalt separately and enable it using its documented Steam launch option, for example `ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 %command%`.

To inspect which parameter values are available before making manual adjustments, run:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --inspect-reshade-parameters="$HOME/Games/MyGame"
```

Pass either the game directory or its `ReShade.ini` file. The inspector uses `PresetPath` when set, otherwise `ReShadePreset.ini`; if that default is missing, it searches beside `ReShade.ini` for a single `.ini` containing enabled techniques. If multiple candidates exist, it asks you to set `PresetPath` rather than guessing. This read-only report lists each enabled technique, its `.fx` source, the saved values found in the active preset, and recognized `uniform` declarations with their source defaults and UI labels/ranges. Values absent from the preset are reported as using the source default. It does not claim that vkBasalt supports those values; vkBasalt's ReShade-effect parameter support is limited, so treat this as a reference for manual review rather than a conversion.

## Update every tracked install

Use the dialog entry named `Update all installed games`, or run:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --update-all
```

Override the tracked shader selection for every game in that batch with:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --update-all --shader-repos=alpha,beta
```

When a requested repo is missing locally, the script relinks only what is available and rewrites the stored state to match the actual result.

## Inspect shader repositories

The built-in registry covers official ReShade shaders plus a wide set of community packs for sharpening, SSR, AO, CRT effects, HDR workflows, LUT grading, cinematic blur, and VR-specific adjustments.

To use shaders from any local pack or checkout, configure `CUSTOM_SHADER_PATH` to its top-level directory containing `Shaders/` and, optionally, `Textures/`, or select that directory when the application prompts you. ReShadeLinux merges those local files only for games where **Custom shaders (local files)** is selected. For example:

```bash
CUSTOM_SHADER_PATH="$HOME/Downloads/GShade" ./reshadelinux.sh
```

You must download the shader source yourself; ReShadeLinux does not fetch arbitrary custom packs. A prompted directory is remembered under `MAIN_PATH` for later installs. For GShade specifically, download it manually: ReShadeLinux does not download or redistribute the `Mortalitas/GShade` repository because its license restricts automatic downloading and redistribution of some included assets. Some GShade effects rely on GShade-specific features and may not work with official ReShade.

Inspect the active registry with:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --list-shader-repos
```

Every picker label is attribution-first:

```text
Pack title by creator | highlights
```

That keeps credit visible in CLI, `dialog`, `whiptail`, and `yad` pickers.

For scripts, add `--json` to print the registry as a JSON array instead of formatted text:

```bash
./reshadelinux.sh --list-shader-repos --json
```

Each object includes `name`, `uri`, `branch`, `title`, `description`, and a `requires` array. Python 3 is required for JSON output.

Replace or trim the registry with `SHADER_REPOS`. Each entry uses this format:

```text
URI|local-name[|branch[|title[|description[|requires]]]]
```

`requires` is a comma-separated list of other local names whose effects the pack needs, for example `immerse-shaders` for a pack that reads the iMMERSE LAUNCHPAD motion vectors. Required packs are cloned and merged automatically without being shown as selected.

Examples:

```bash
SHADER_REPOS='https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders|reshade-shaders|slim|ReShade Shaders|Official built-ins' ./reshadelinux.sh
SHADER_REPOS='https://github.com/martymcmodding/qUINT|quintfx||qUINT|MXAO, SSR, Bloom' ./reshadelinux.sh --list-shader-repos
```

Older four-field overrides still work. When `title` is omitted, the script falls back to the repo name.

## Configure runtime behavior

Set environment variables inline when you need a different runtime profile.

```bash
VARIABLE=value ./reshadelinux.sh
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAIN_PATH` | `~/.local/share/reshade` | Store ReShade payloads, shader clones, and per-game state here. When both **Native** and **Flatpak** installations are found, choose one or select a custom folder with **Manual**. |
| `UI_BACKEND` | `auto` | Force `auto`, `yad`, `whiptail`, `dialog`, or `cli`. Forced non-CLI backends must exist on `PATH`. |
| `UPDATE_RESHADE` | `1` | Skip update checks when set to `0`. |
| `RESHADE_VERSION` | `latest` | Pin a specific ReShade version such as `4.9.1`. |
| `RESHADE_ADDON_SUPPORT` | `0` | Use the addon-enabled ReShade build when set to `1`. |
| `SHADER_REPOS` | built-in registry | Provide a semicolon-separated list of `URI\|local-name[\|branch[\|title[\|description[\|requires]]]]` entries. |
| `CUSTOM_SHADER_PATH` | remembered local selection | Point to a local shader directory containing `Shaders/` and optionally `Textures/`; otherwise the shader picker prompts when **Custom shaders (local files)** is selected. `GSHADE_PATH` remains accepted as a deprecated compatibility alias. |
| `FIRST_RUN_SHADER_REPOS` | `reshade-shaders,sweetfx-shaders,quintfx,prod80-shaders,astrayfx-shaders` | Pick the default first-run shader subset. Unknown names are ignored. If none match, the full configured list is used. |
| `GAME_DIR_PRESETS` | empty | Override exe subdirectories for specific App IDs such as `12345\|Binaries/Win64`. |
| `EXTRA_DLL_OVERRIDES` | empty | Add DLL override names to the accepted list (`d3d8 d3d9 d3d11 d3d12 ddraw dinput8 dxgi opengl32`), separated by spaces or commas, for example `winmm`. Only plain names are accepted. Applies to `--dll-override`, the manual prompt and `--update-all`. |
| `SHADER_CORE_REPOS` | `reshade-shaders` | Packs that hold the headers every other pack includes (`ReShade.fxh`, `ReShadeUI.fxh`). They are always cloned and their headers linked, so a pack selected on its own still compiles; their effects only appear when selected. |
| `SHADER_BROKEN_EFFECTS` | see `lib/config.sh` | Comma-separated effect paths (relative to a pack's `Shaders` folder) left out of every game because they fail to compile with ReShade 6.8 on Proton. Set it empty to keep them. |
| `GLOBAL_INI` | `ReShade.ini` | Use this as the per-game template. Set to `0` to let ReShade create it later. |
| `LINK_PRESET` | empty | Copy a preset `.ini` from `MAIN_PATH` into a game directory on first install. |
| `WINEPREFIX` | auto | Force a specific Wine or Proton prefix instead of auto-detecting from `compatdata`. |
| `DELETE_RESHADE_FILES` | `0` | Also remove `ReShade.log` and `ReShadePreset.ini` during uninstall. |
| `FORCE_RESHADE_UPDATE_CHECK` | `0` | Bypass the four-hour update throttle. |
| `PROGRESS_UI` | `1` | Disable progress widgets without changing the selected dialog backend. |
| `RESHADE_DEBUG_LOG` | empty | Append timestamped debug lines here for backend or flow debugging. |
| `RESHADE_SETUP_SHA256` | empty | Require the downloaded official ReShade setup executable to match this 64-character sha256 before extraction continues. Anything that is not a plain hex digest is rejected. |
| `NO_COLOR` | unset | Turn colour off even on a terminal ([no-color.org](https://no-color.org)). Output that is not a terminal is never coloured. |
| `CLICOLOR_FORCE` | unset | Set to `1` to colour output that is not a terminal, for example when piping into a pager. |
| `UI_AUTO_CONFIRM` | `0` | Testing hook: answers every dialog automatically. A warning is printed when it is on. Do not set it for normal use. |

## Pass explicit command-line options

Use flags when you want to drive the installer directly.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--update-all` | Re-link ReShade for every tracked game without entering the per-game install flow. Combine with `--shader-repos` when you want a batch-wide override. |
| `--cli` | Force the plain CLI backend. This is shorthand for `--ui-backend=cli`. |
| `--ui-backend=<backend>` | Force `auto`, `yad`, `whiptail`, `dialog`, or `cli`. Do not combine with `--cli`. |
| `--game-path=<path>` | Use an explicit game directory or `.exe` path. |
| `--app-id=<appid>` | Select a detected Steam game by App ID, or persist that App ID alongside `--game-path`. |
| `--dll-override=<name>` | Use an explicit DLL override such as `dxgi`, `d3d9`, `opengl32`, or `dinput8`. |
| `--shader-repos=<value>` | Use `all`, `none`, or a comma-separated list of repo names; `custom-local` selects the directory configured by `CUSTOM_SHADER_PATH` (or prompts for it). Legacy `gshade-local` is still accepted as an alias. With `--update-all`, this becomes the batch override. |
| `--list-shader-repos` | Print configured shader repo names and human-readable labels, then exit. |
| `--json` | With `--list-shader-repos`, print repository metadata as a JSON array. |
| `--generate-vkbasalt-config=<game-dir>` | Generate a non-overwriting per-game vkBasalt config from the active ReShade preset. |
| `--inspect-reshade-parameters=<game-dir|ReShade.ini>` | Read-only report of enabled effects, saved preset values, and source uniforms/defaults. |
| `--version`, `-V` | Print the current script version. |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show the built-in usage summary. |

## Launch the GUI wrapper directly

```bash
./reshadelinux-gui.sh
```

This wrapper prefers `UI_BACKEND=yad` when `yad` is installed and otherwise falls back to the normal backend selection. AppImage launcher assets live in [packaging/appimage/AppDir](packaging/appimage/AppDir).

## Explore the repository

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `reshadelinux.sh` | Main entrypoint for install, update, and uninstall flows. |
| `reshadelinux-gui.sh` | Small wrapper that prefers the graphical backend when `yad` exists. |
| `lib/` | Production Bash modules for config, UI, state, shaders, Steam detection, and flow orchestration. |
| `packaging/appimage/` | AppImage launcher assets, metadata, and icon files. |
| `scripts/diagnostics/` | Local smoke scripts and troubleshooting helpers. |
| `tests/` | Shell regression suites, fixtures, and helper loaders. |
| `scripts/release/` | Release automation that builds and publishes the AppImage. |
| `docs/research/` | Design notes and backlog ideas that are not yet implemented. |

## Know what is trusted

- ReShade itself is downloaded only from `reshade.me` or `static.reshade.me`, and only from an exact `ReShade_Setup_<version>.exe` address. The project publishes no checksum, so set `RESHADE_SETUP_SHA256` if you want to pin a build. `d3dcompiler_47.dll` is always checked against a built-in hash.
- The shader packs are third-party Git repositories, cloned at the head of their default branch and not pinned to a commit. They are shader source that ReShade compiles, not programs this installer runs. Use `SHADER_REPOS` or `External_shaders/` if you want a reviewed set.
- A real `ReShade_shaders` folder already in a game directory is moved aside to `ReShade_shaders.bak-<timestamp>` rather than deleted.

## Pick alternatives for Vulkan-native games

For native Vulkan games, or Windows games running through DXVK or VKD3D, use one of these instead:

- [vkBasalt](https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt) for a Vulkan post-processing layer that works with native Linux games, DXVK, and VKD3D.
- [Gamescope](https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/) plus vkBasalt when you want compositor-level post-processing instead of injecting into the game itself.
